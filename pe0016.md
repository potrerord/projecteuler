# Problem 16 (in-progress train of thought)

> What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

First thought is that $2^{1000}$ could probably be solved with Wolfram Alpha, then I could copy/paste the result into a program and parse it as a string.

But that feels lame, and I'm sure there's an algorithmic relationship between powers of 2 and the sums of their digits. $2^{1000}$ also obviously goes well beyond the limits of 64-bit binary integer representation, so I don't think I can just brute-force the calculation on my own within a program.

One thought I'm having right now is that the binary representation for all of these could be cut to a fourth of the binary length as a hexadecimal integer. If $2^{1000}$ would be $1001$ bits long in binary, it would be more manageable to represent it with $251$ hex digits.

The reason this feels important is because I can sense that a while-loop incrementer style solution would probably work here. For any of these first 21 powers of 2, it would make sense to just start with the full quantity and then do something like [1 followed by 1,000 bits] % $(1010)_{2}$... wait new thought:

(let s(x) represent the sum of the digits of the base-10 representation of x):

|  $k$ | $s(k)$ |  $k$ | $s(k)$ | ... |  $k$ | $s(k)$ |  $k$ | $s(k)$ | ... |  $k$ | $s(k)$ |
| ---: | :----- | ---: | :----- | --- | ---: | :----- | ---: | :----- | --- | ---: | :----- |

|    4 | 4      |   14 | 5      | ... |   94 | 13     |  104 | 5      |     |  994 | 22     |
|    5 | 5      |   15 | 6      | ... |   95 | 14     |  105 | 6      |     |  995 | 23     |
|    6 | 6      |   16 | 7      | ... |   96 | 15     |  106 | 7      |     |  996 | 24     |
|    7 | 7      |   17 | 8      | ... |   97 | 16     |  107 | 8      |     |  997 | 25     |
|    8 | 8      |   18 | 9      | ... |   98 | 17     |  108 | 9      |     |  998 | 26     |
|    9 | 9      |   19 | 10     | ... |   99 | 18     |  109 | 10     |     |  999 | 27     |


This seems obvious but it's useful for me to see the ranges reset every 10 visually lol.

Nvm okay back to the original graph actually I just noticed something trippy:

Okay yes this is indeed trippy bc there definitely seems to be some sort of recursive relationship to be found here. I'm assuming that if this pattern continues, then each base-10 power of 2's digit-sum will have the same recursive digit sum as the double of the previous digit-sum.

The thing that makes this really interesting is that the pattern is broken by rows 13 and 20. I wanted to be able to say "each digsum is 2 times the previous digsum" but I had to use the word "recursive" a bunch of times bc of rows 13 and 20 lol. Obviously it appears that if I made more sets of columns for s(the previous columns) then I'd eventually end with two identical columns. I'm trying to figure out what makes 13 and 20 special.

My main issue at the moment is determining when a digitsum "gets to" be double the previous one, versus when it's removed by some number of degrees of separation. Rows 3/4/5 give us 8/7/5 for instance, while rows 9/10/11 give us 8/7/14. I suspect it might be related to the number of digits in the base 10 representation, but I'm not sure yet.

Maybe that second graph has some useful knowledge -- perhaps the fact that the range of possible sums "resets" every 10 to start at a certain number related to the range of the previous 10 is relevant here.

Okay new thought after observing these graphs for a while: it seems significant that the range of possible digit sums for each base-10 integer of length "$l$" is $[1, 9l]$. For example, 100 to 999 will give us a number in [1, 27]. It seems like this fact may influence how we're able to get from one $s(2^{n})$ row to the next without having to actually calculate the entire power of 2 itself.

If we can calculate the accepted range as a function of $n$, then we can potentially find the *only number in that range that will give us the eventual sum we are looking for*.

Brainstorm/example: Row 13\
If we take Row 12's 19 and double it, we get 38. If we add the digits of 38, we get 11. However, it seems that 11 must be out of Row 13's acceptable 10-digit range. That means that it's not the 11 that matters -- we have to go recursively deeper until we hit a single digit. s(11) is 2, which means we need to find the "2" within the 10-digit range that Row 13 is a member of. 8192 is within the 1000-9999 range, [discarding train of thought]

Brainstorm/example: Row 6\
This is the first row where s(2^n) doesn't get collapsed, and is allowed to remain a 2-digit number. [discarding train of thought]

The more I think about this from different angles, the more it seems like I'm gonna need some sort of formula to determine how many base-10 digits a power of 2 requires, without needing to actually calculate that power of 2.

Time to take a break lol I'll return someday 👀

I just realized the final digit of each power starting from $2^{1}$ is cyclical, following the pattern $\{2, 4, 8, 6\}$. This means that 2 to the power of a >1 multiple of 4  will produce a number that ends in a 6, which means $2^{1000}$ ends in a 6. That's a start for sure.

Looks like if I try to extend this logic to the second digit from the right, it becomes more complicated. I think it won't be possible to predict the behavior of the second digit in the same way because it relies on its own previous value *and* the value of the ones-place digit. In other words, I think I need to check $2^{1}$ to $2^{100}$ in order to find the spot where the final 2 digits of the number repeat, then I think I'll be able to start seeing a pattern. Actually, since the final digit can only be one of 4 numbers, I bet a repeat will happen within the firsttttt..... 40? I'll write a quick program to figure this out.
