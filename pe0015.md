# Problem 15

> Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \times 2$ grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right corner.\
\
How many such routes are there through a $20 \times 20$ grid?

Let $R$ represent a right movement.\
Let $D$ represent a down movement.

Each unique route can be represented by a binary string of $R$'s and $D$'s containing equal amounts of each, e.g. $RDRD$.

The cardinality of the set of distinct binary strings of length $l$ with $n$ amount of one character is equal to $\binom{l}{n}$ or $\binom{l}{l-n}$. To take the above example, $\binom{4}{2} = \binom{4}{4-2} = 6$.

In this case, we have a string of length $40$ with $20$ $R$'s (or $20$ $D$'s):

$\binom{40}{20} = \frac{40!}{(20!)(20!)} = 137{,}846{,}528{,}820$
